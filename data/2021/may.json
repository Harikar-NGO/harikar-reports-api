For GP-Case Management, a shortage of service providers remains a fundamental barrier. We are unable to travel to Sinune due to the lateness of the authorization letters, making it difficult to supervise the implementation of the activities, particularly since we are unable to travel to Sinune we can't disturb the Cash for Protection, and access to some regions is difficult even with our native staff due to security concerns."
